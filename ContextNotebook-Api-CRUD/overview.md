# Overview

The `MindWorx.Api.Example` solution is an API template that provides a clean and maintainable architecture for building web APIs using .NET Core. It implements a layered design that promotes separation of concerns, code reuse, and testability.

This implementation follows:
- **SOLID principles** for extensibility and modularity
- **DRY** to minimize repetition
- **KISS** to keep code readable and intuitive

## Architecture

| Layer | Project | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| API | MindWorx.Web.Api | Handles HTTP requests and routing |
| Business | MindWorx.Web.BusinessLayer | Contains services with business logic |
| Data | MindWorx.Web.DataLayer | EF Core repositories and entities |
| DTOs | MindWorx.Web.Client.Dto | Defines contracts for data exchange |
| Mapping | MindWorx.Web.BusinessLayer.Mapping | Converts between Entities and DTOs |
| Validation | MindWorx.Web.BusinessLayer.Validation | FluentValidation rules |
| Core Infrastructure | MindWorx.Data.EntityFramework | BaseRepository and shared patterns |

## Patterns and Practices

- **Controllers** are thin; they delegate to services.
- **Services** handle orchestration: logging, validation, mapping, and repository calls.
- **Repositories** follow the repository pattern and inherit from a shared `BaseRepository` for CRUD operations.
- **DTOs** decouple external contracts from internal entities.
- **Validation** uses FluentValidation with `AbstractValidator<T>`.
- **Mapping** uses extension methods to keep logic centralized and testable.

This architecture ensures high cohesion and loose coupling between components, making the API easy to test, extend, and maintain.
